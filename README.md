# Advent of Code 2024
Here is my attempt to achive completion of the "Advent of Code 2024", this is the first time IÂ´m trying to participate, so my code will have many "errors" (opportunities for improvement), but that's the ideal, to allow me to challenge myself and also improve my coding skills along the way...

If you're using VS Code, please look for the main function and press the "Run" option, make sure you have the debug console open in order to view the execution results.
